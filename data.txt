A guide to ‘At our
best: our Code’

The choices we make and the things we do must be
guided by our values and behaviours. Being trusted
to deliver excellence, acting with integrity by always
doing the right thing, and operating safely in whatever
we do, will mean that we strengthen our business
and enable its success. It is also important that we
operate in accordance with our behaviours which are
to pursue collaboration, seek simplicity, embrace agility
and be bold.
From time to time, we all need a little help to do the right
thing, no matter what our job is or where we are located.
That is what our Code is for. It does not have all the
answers to every situation we may face but it does set
out our principles and how they apply to our business
activities, to guide our decision-making and direct us
where to go for additional guidance and help.

Who does it apply to?

All of us. That’s all colleagues employed by the
Rolls-Royce Group and any subsidiary or joint
venture where we have control. We also encourage
all our joint ventures and partners to adopt the same
high standards.

Our responsibilities

Whatever our role, we hold the reputation of
Rolls-Royce in our hands. By doing the right
thing, we safeguard our reputation as a trusted
business, and make this a company where we
can be at our best.

Each one of us has responsibility to:
• Be accountable for our actions;
• Be aware of the shadow we cast and lead by example
to promote and display the highest standards
of integrity and professionalism;
• Consider how our decisions and actions affect those
around us and make sure everyone has the help
and support they need; and
• Create an environment in which everyone feels
safe to speak up.
We must make sure:
• We are open to receiving improvement ideas
or concerns, and they are taken seriously and
followed up appropriately;
• We treat those who speak up with fairness and
without prejudice;
• We all have access to our Code, our Group Policies
and other policies relevant to our role or place of work;
• We complete mandatory training; and
• Relevant topics within our Code are discussed
regularly in our team meetings.

While all elements of the people framework support

for ourselves in our Code and the policies that support
them. Therefore, we will take appropriate action against
anyone who does not live up to these principles, values
and behaviours, or breaches our policies.

Our Code supports our values and behaviours, drawing
out principles to help us navigate many of the business
dilemmas we might encounter. We are also supported
by the Governance Framework and Group Policies that
we abide by as a company and as individuals. In addition,
there may be local policies and laws that will apply
depending on our job role or work location.

Identifying and solving dilemmas

It is not possible for our Code to anticipate every
situation or set out every legal or company requirement.
In some situations, we need to use common sense and
good judgement – based on the principles set out here
– to make the right decisions. If we are faced with a
dilemma and we are unsure how to solve it, the TRUST
model can help us do the right thing, in line with our
principles and what’s expected of us.

In the course of our work, if we find ourselves hearing
or saying phrases like the ones below, it might mean we
are facing a dilemma, or witnessing something wrong or
illegal happening and we should take action to resolve it:
• “No one will ever know.”
• “It doesn’t matter how it gets done as long as it
gets done.”
• “Everyone else does it, so it must be ok.”
• “Don’t worry; it’s the way we do things around here.”
• “I don’t want to know.”

Not sure about the situation
you are facing?
Ask yourself these questions:
• Are these actions open, legal, fair
and honest?
• Is this how I would like to be treated or how
I would want Rolls-Royce to be treated?
• How would I feel about myself afterwards?
• How would this issue look if it was reported
in the media?
• Would I be comfortable explaining this
in court?
• How would I feel if my family and friends
knew about my actions?

Speak up

We should always assume positive intent, that is,
expect that other people are trying to create a good
outcome for all of us. That way we can have open and
positive conversations. We need to be open-minded
to approaches from other people who have ideas,
questions or concerns, even if they are about our own
actions or behaviours.
When we are open and take responsibility for doing
the right thing, we all do better and succeed together.
So let’s create the kind of workplace where we strive
to achieve the highest standards of integrity and
professionalism and ensure we encourage each other
to speak up.
Speaking up isn’t just about calling out things we believe
are wrong; it’s about recognising what’s good, and
suggesting how to make things better.

We speak up if we…
• Have ideas to simplify and improve the way we work;
• Witness, are aware of, or subject to anything we
believe is bullying, harassment or discrimination,
or any other inappropriate behaviour;
• Appreciate the contribution of others;
• Suspect bribery, corruption, fraud or facilitation
of tax evasion or other criminal offences;
• Can help others to achieve results;
• Have any concerns about possible health and safety,
quality, product safety or reliability issues;
• See positive or negative examples of the shadows
we cast;
• Believe we have received or divulged information
we are not entitled to have or share;
• Can suggest how to reduce waste;
• Have any concerns about how personal data
is being handled;
• Can share knowledge or best practice to improve
our business;
• Have any suspicions or allegations of anticompetitive behaviour;
• Make a mistake, knowing we will be treated fairly;
• Receive suspicious enquiries from anyone who might
be trying to gain unauthorised access to our goods,
software or technology;
• Are concerned about any other breaches of laws; and
• Identify risks that could affect us in achieving
our objectives.

Questions and concerns
Whenever we have a question or concern, our manager
is the first person to turn to. If we can’t do that then we
contact someone with expertise in the matter. It might
also help to talk to an employee representative such
as a member of a works council or a union. There may
also be local reporting systems we can use. We can
speak to a Local Ethics Adviser or raise our questions
or concerns through the Rolls-Royce Ethics Line.
The most important thing is to speak up and talk
to someone who can help. If we are approached
by a colleague wanting help we will try to help each
other find the right place or person to get an answer.
Look at the Speak Up Policy to see how concerns are
dealt with and what we can expect to happen when we
raise a concern.
Retaliation
We can ask questions and raise concerns without fear
of retaliation. Retaliation against anyone who speaks
up is not acceptable at Rolls-Royce and could result
in disciplinary action.

Local Ethics Advisers

Ethics Line

Line managers are our first point
of contact. They are there for us
to talk to about any questions or
concerns we have, and to support
us to resolve them.

There are subject matter experts who
support all the topic areas within our
Code. For example, we can contact
Human Resources to talk about
concerns about working together.
There may also be union or works
council representatives who can also
advise us on how to resolve a question
or concern.

Local Ethics Advisers are colleagues
from a variety of functions and levels
in the organisation who take on this
role in addition to their existing job.
They will listen to issues in confidence
and will guide you to the best subject
matter expert to help. If necessary
they can escalate the concern to
the subject matter expert for advice
or investigation.

We can ask a question or raise a
concern through the Rolls‑Royce
Ethics Line by logging on to
www.rolls-royce.com/ethicsline
and completing an online form
or calling one of the in-country
telephone numbers provided. It is
an independently-managed service,
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
in multiple languages. The question
or concern is forwarded to the Ethics
and Compliance team who involve the
right subject matter expert to provide
an answer or investigate a concern.
Questions or concerns can be dealt
with anonymously, but it really helps
the success of an investigation when
we can talk directly to get all the facts.

Local laws in some countries may restrict
the types of concerns that can be raised
using the Rolls-Royce Ethics Line, and the
ability to remain anonymous. The Rolls‑Royce
Ethics Line gives details of any restrictions.
To find out more about what happens when
you ask a question or report a concern,

and Environment (HS&E) goals.
• We take accountability to help protect and enhance
health, wellbeing and environmental performance.
• We never put ourselves or others at risk from
our actions.
• We stop work if we think it might be unsafe,

We will:

• Set and expect the highest standards of behaviour
for protecting our own and others’ health and
safety. We should expect the same from the others
around us;
• Assume positive intent and stay open-minded to
others who express health or wellbeing concerns
about our own actions or behaviours; and
• Follow our life-saving rules.

What happens when…
QQ

We have really tight deadlines to get this
project finished and we are sometimes
working around our safety routine.
We know it’s not ideal, but if it gets the
job finished, is this ok?

AA

No matter how tight the deadlines, safety
procedures must never be compromised.
Start by speaking to your manager
about your worries. If you feel that’s
not possible, speak to the next level of
management or your HS&E manager.

QQ

I am feeling under a lot of pressure,
I don’t think I can cope with my workload
and don’t know what I can do about it?

AA

It’s important to safeguard your health
at work, so speak to your manager;
they will be sympathetic. You can also
get support and advice from your local
Occupational Health provider or from
Human Resources.

QQ

I think I’ve seen something going on in
our business that might be harming the
local environment. Is this a serious issue?

AA

Yes, what you’ve seen might put us
in breach of national environmental
legislation, as well as cause damage to
our environment. Tell your manager
what you’ve seen, or talk to your HS&E
manager as soon as possible.

Product Safety

2.0

Operate safely

Principles

We will:

• Everyone who works at Rolls-Royce shares
responsibility for product safety.
• We are aware of the safety impact of our actions and
accept that we all have a duty to protect and improve
product safety.
• We prioritise safety-related tasks so they get the right
attention, time and resource.

• Be curious and take action to anticipate and identify
potential product safety risks;
• Not act in any way that could have a negative impact
on the safety of our products; and
• Assume positive intent and stay open-minded if
others express product safety concerns, even if they
are about our own behaviours.

Group Policies
Product Safety

Our product safety goal is to eliminate, as far as possible, the risk
of product failure. This includes anything that could affect the safe
operation of the Rolls-Royce product, the platform on which the
product is installed, the people using or maintaining the product,
or any long-term negative impact to the environment in which
it operates.

What happens when…
QQ

I believe that the way a new product is
being built might, under certain rare
circumstances, lead to safety issues.
It’s a remote chance and the product
is important to us and our customer
so I don’t need to say anything, do I?

AA

Yes! The safety of our products is vital to
the lives and livelihoods of thousands of
people, and our reputation and success
depend on it. Always speak up about your
concerns. All product safety concerns must
be raised using Group Procedure Product
Safety 3.1 to ensure the accountable person
is made aware and can take appropriate
action. Start by speaking to your manager.
If you feel unable to speak to your manager,
ask the next level of management or your
local Head of Product Safety Assurance
for advice. Or you can speak to your Local
Ethics Adviser or raise the concern on the
Rolls-Royce Ethics Line. Whichever route
you take, it is important to speak up.

QQ

I think I could make our safety processes
even better. What do I do if I have
feedback or concerns?

AA

Our procedures incorporate the very
best safety practices, and ensure we
are compliant with safety regulations.
In the spirit of continuous improvement,
any feedback and recommendations
are welcome! A change request can
be raised via Group Procedure Quality
Instruction 1.1. If you have any questions,
you can also speak to the Process Author
or your manager.

procedures that safeguard the safety, quality
and reliability of our products and services.

What happens when…
QQ

I heard that our work really has to be
‘good enough’ not perfect, so I can work
around the quality procedures. I can be
more productive too, so that’s a good
thing, right?

AA

Wrong. Quality procedures are there to
keep our work safe, reliable and to meet
our customers’ specifications. We can
never compromise these. If you have
any doubts, start by speaking to your
manager. If you feel you can’t, speak to
the next level of management or your
Quality point of contact.

QQ

I’m new to my area and I’m not sure which
procedures I’m responsible for operating.
How do I find out?

AA

Everyone needs to know all the
procedures that guide their work, so they
can do it right and be accountable for it.
Ask your manager for a full briefing.

Trusted to Deliver Excellence
Principles

• We treat all our customers, suppliers and partners
with fairness, honesty and respect, and build
relationships that work for all parties, no matter
what the transaction is worth or how long it lasts.
• We support communities in areas of education
and skills, environment, social investment and arts,
culture and heritage. Our investment can include
financial, time or in-kind support.
• We compete fairly and with integrity on sales
campaigns and bids for external research funding.
• If we employ people who have recently worked for
government, a competitor or a customer we will not
involve them in sales activities if that might give us
an unfair advantage.
• When seeking new suppliers and partners we
conduct appropriate due diligence. We take
steps to only choose suppliers and partners
whose values and business behaviour meet high
ethical standards.
• We are opposed to any form of child labour,
or any practices that hold back the development
of children. Employment should be freely chosen,
so we’ll never use forced or involuntary labour.

When working with customers – we will:

• Make sure that all our bid preparations, contract
negotiations and communications with customers
are accurate and true;
• Set out clear terms in our contracts with
customers and operate in line with them;
• Not accept information about a competitor’s
proposal in a sales campaign;
• Not accept internal government information
on its selection process unless the government’s
contracting officer has specifically and lawfully
authorised its release; and
• Strive to continuously improve quality, delivery,
responsiveness and reliability to build high levels
of customer satisfaction.

What happens when…
QQ

A friend who works for a competitor
has given me information about a sales
campaign that Rolls-Royce is also
involved in. It would give us a great
opportunity to beat them to this contract
so should I use it?

AA

No, do not use this information; using
it is unfair competition and unethical.
Immediately discuss this with your
manager and contact the Ethics and
Compliance team for guidance.

Human Rights
We recognise our responsibility to respect
Human Rights. We are committed to protecting
and preserving the rights of our employees,
those employed in our supply chain and those
affected by our operations.

What happens when…
QQ

One of the suppliers we use has given
me a really competitive price, though
this seems to be because their pay is low
– possibly below the legal minimum. It’s
good for us, but I’m not sure I’m happy.

AA

You should discuss your concerns
with your manager and the manager
responsible for this supplier. We are
committed to making sure that our
suppliers do not unlawfully exploit
their employees.

QQ

I saw an email that makes me think one
of my colleagues might be doing some
kind of deal with a supplier to say that
they are providing a service that we
don’t actually get. I might be wrong,
what should I do?

AA

You are right to be concerned
about protecting our company.
Immediately report the matter in
accordance with the guidance in the

When working with our communities – we will:

What happens when…

• Make sure that all charitable contributions and
social sponsorships, which may be given in time
and gifts-in-kind as well as money:
–– sit comfortably within our policy and have been
approved and reported;
–– are legitimate, appropriate and proportionate;
–– can’t be interpreted as trying to influence the
giver or the receiver (e.g. be seen as bribes) and
• Not use the company’s funds or assets for
political donations.

Why do we invest in our communities? Because it supports our
future success by:
• Helping us to attract, recruit and retain the best people with
the right skills from many different backgrounds, particularly
by investing in the skills we need;
• Providing us with opportunities to engage with each other
and develop our skills and behaviours while we have a positive
impact in our communities; and
• Helping to show our customers, investors and other
stakeholders the kind of company we are.

QQ

Can I get support to help my
local charity?

AA

We do support not-for-profit
organisations including charities,
schools and community groups.
Many contributions are in time and gifts
in-kind, as well as financial donations.
Make sure these sit within our Charitable
Contributions and Social Sponsorships
Policy, have a legitimate purpose, and are
approved by your line manager. Talk to
the Community Investment team if you
need more advice.

QQ

A customer has asked me if Rolls-Royce
will make a donation to its charity as part
of our bid. The charity looks legitimate so
can I do this?

AA

Even if this is a legitimate charity, the
connection between the proposed
donation and the bid could mean that
this is seen as a bribe. You should
politely decline.

• We engage and involve our people in improving
the business and welcome feedback.
• We rely on a diverse and inclusive workplace free
from discrimination and we will not tolerate bullying,
harassment or discrimination of any kind.

What happens when…

• We encourage regular and effective conversations
with managers, and to give and ask for feedback,
so we can all be our best.
• Our company will reward us fairly, taking into
account our individual contribution and behaviour.
• We resolve disputes fairly.
• Deciding whether or not to join a trade union is our
own choice. Our company will respect the collective
representation and consultation processes and laws
in the countries where we work.

QQ

We’ve been asked to work on a really
important project with a very short
deadline. I know that we may have
to work long hours to get it done.
The parents in my team have to leave
early for the school run, so I’m only going
to ask people without children to be a
part of the project team. Is this ok?

AA

This is not ok. Be curious and ask the
team who can support – the parents may
have a great support network and can
do work later at night once the school
run is done. Diversity makes us more
innovative, helps to prevent group think
and ensures you get the best result for
the project and for Rolls-Royce.

QQ

One of my colleagues always makes
‘jokes’ about my appearance and
keeps asking me for meetings alone
that we don’t need. It makes me feel
uncomfortable, but my manager said it’s
just banter and that asking him to stop
would hurt his feelings. Am I making a
fuss out of nothing?

AA

We take allegations of harassment
seriously and it is not ok to feel
uncomfortable at work. If you have
already spoken to your manager and it
hasn’t been resolved, speak with Human
Resources. They will help you navigate
the next steps.

AA

We’re close to the end of the quarter and it
looks like we won’t meet our target unless
we really push. I’m stressed and need my
team to work harder, so it’s understandable
that I yell sometimes, isn’t it?
As a manager, you’re expected to set
challenging targets but it is never ok
to bully or intimidate to achieve them.
Yelling rarely motivates; instead try to
analyse what’s stopping your team from
achieving their goals and support their
efforts to overcome this. If there are team
members who genuinely need performance
improvement, support and manage
this appropriately.

QQ

I have been in my role for 18 months now
and am still waiting for my first performance
check-in. I’ve spoken to my manager,
but we’re all so busy that it hasn’t been
scheduled. Is this ok?

AA

Regular check-ins are vital for your
development and your manager is
responsible for scheduling these regularly.
Ask your manager again for a regular
session to be arranged, and if you still need
support ask Human Resources for help.

QQ

I’m a manager and someone in my team has
come to me with a complaint. Should I send
them to Human Resources?

AA

Complaints and grievances should be
resolved as soon as possible. First speak
with the team member and try to resolve
the issue together. If this doesn’t work,
speak with Human Resources. They will help
you navigate the process in your location.

QQ

My daughter has just been employed as a
Rolls-Royce engineer in Canada. I work for
Rolls-Royce in the US. Is this a problem?

AA

Not all family relationships will automatically
be a conflict of interest, it depends on
whether either of you are in a position to
influence future opportunities or benefits
the other receives. You should disclose
your daughter’s employment as a potential
conflict of interest. Speak with your line
manager to get this process started.

Conflicts of interest
Trusted to Deliver Excellence

Principles

• We avoid any situation where conflicts of interest
might be seen as influencing our business
decisions or behaviour, or which might stop us
from acting in the best interests of Rolls-Royce.
• If we believe there is, or might be, a conflict of
interest, we speak up.
• We work within all laws and regulations relating
to the employment or engagement of current
or former military and civilian government
personnel, customers and competitors.
• We comply with all relevant insider dealing
and market abuse legislation.

We will:

• Tell our manager about actual or potential conflicts
of interest so that they can be managed;
• Not provide any services in a personal capacity to
any actual or potential competitor, supplier, customer
or other business partner, unless given approval
in advance;
• Not place ourselves in a position where we manage
or have the ability to influence business decisions
relevant to a customer, supplier or other business
partner in which we, a family member or close
personal friend has a substantial interest;
• Not use non-public information for our own personal
benefit, or pass this kind of information to someone
else (either inside or outside the company) who isn’t
authorised to have it; and
• Not deal in Rolls-Royce shares in an unauthorised way
or encourage others to do so.

What happens when…
QQ

My partner works for a company
that supplies us with equipment.
Recently I have been made responsible
for managing contracts and buying
services from this company. I feel a bit
uncomfortable about it, should I ask for
a transfer?

AA

You’re right to be aware of the risk,
as it could be a conflict of interest,
depending on your partner’s role in the
company. Don’t do anything until you’ve
explained this to your manager or spoken
with the Ethics and Compliance team,
as it may just be a case of reporting
the connection.

QQ

In my role, I have often dealt with military
customers. One of them has asked me
if he could get a job with Rolls-Royce
after he leaves the armed forces.
He has the right kind of skills for us, so
can I help him?

AA

It’s possible that any conversation
about jobs with us would be seen
as offering a benefit to a customer
and trying to influence a decision.
There are also laws and regulations in
many countries about employing former
military personnel which we have to
follow. So do not discuss any employment
opportunities with him, but suggest he
looks at the recruitment areas of the
Rolls-Royce website.

QQ

To raise money for a Rolls-Royce
community charity, we’re holding a ball.
We have organised a photo booth and
photographer for the evening. We want
to show people what a fun place it is to
work so is it ok to share the photos from
the ball on social media?

AA

You need to be careful when sharing
personal data, like photos, on social
media as there are laws to protect our
privacy. Many people do not like pictures
shared online. Before the event ask your
manager if it’s the right thing to do.
You can also contact the Data Privacy
team about the risks and how to stay
inside the law.

QQ

When my manager was asking people
to sign a get-well card for a colleague
I overheard her talking about the
details of their illness. It made me feel
uncomfortable, knowing something so
personal, and I’m not sure it’s right.

AA

Personal data should never be shared
without consent, or a legal reason.
Even in the same company or team, only
necessary personal information should
be disclosed. Your manager means well,
but unless they have consent to share
this information they may have breached
privacy laws and Rolls-Royce policy.

• Use and protect personal data, in line with
applicable laws, and our internal privacy policies
and guidance; and
• Never give out anyone’s personal data without
making sure there is a lawful reason to do so.

I’m really proud of an invention I’ve
developed at Rolls-Royce. It could
change the way we do things here
and I think I should get it patented.
I’ve started talking to a friend who is
a lawyer about it, is this ok?

AA

Patent applications may not be accepted
if you disclose the invention first. If you
have created something novel and
beneficial to Rolls-Royce speak with our
Intellectual Property team. They can
guide you on whether you should apply
for a patent and what to do next.

QQ

I have a Rolls-Royce laptop and often
work at home. My son’s computer is
broken and he needs access to use the
internet for school. Is it ok for my son to
use my laptop?

AA

It’s understood that you might sometimes
need to use your laptop for personal
use. But our systems are for business
purposes, so keep this to a minimum
and ensure that it does not interrupt
or conflict with your ability to get your
work done. And of course, accessing
illegal, offensive or inappropriate
material is never ok. Read the IT and

Accurate business records
Trusted to Deliver Excellence

Principles

• We maintain accurate and complete records of
our business dealings. These include all transactions
between our business and external individuals
and organisations, and all expenditure and
labour charges.
• We act in line with the law and applicable technical
and professional standards.
• We prepare our financial records on time,
representing the facts accurately and completely.
A business record is any document or communication created
or received in the course of doing business. For example,
this includes financial records, quality records, legal records,
travel and expenses records, or work booking records.

What happens if…

• We maintain a rigorous system of financial,
operational and compliance controls
and an effective system of risk management.
• We do not engage in fraud, money laundering
or tax evasion, nor do we facilitate the tax evasion
of others.

QQ

We’re getting close to using up all our
budget. I’ve been asked to move some
costs to another department, as they
have underspent this year. My manager
has assured me this is above-board,
should I make the adjustment?

AA

A: You can only move costs between
departments or businesses when there
is a valid reason (e.g. having completed
work for the department). To ensure you
aren’t artificially manipulating results,
double check the reason for the change
with your manager.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption

We will:

• Not give or receive bribes, and will report to the
Ethics and Compliance team if we are asked for,
or offered, bribes or facilitation payments;
• Only offer, or accept, gifts or hospitality allowed
within policy; and
• Consult our Ethics and Compliance team
about any business partners that we engage
with to make sure that we are conducting the
appropriate due diligence on the partner.

What happens when…
QQ

I get on very well with an external
business contact. Can I take them out for
a meal after a meeting?

AA

You may be able to have the meal if that
is appropriate – for example, you are
continuing your business discussion.
But it is important that it should not be
viewed as inappropriately influencing
them. The Gifts and Hospitality Policy has
details of the financial limits and when
you need to get approval, as well as more
general guidance on when it may not
be appropriate to give or receive gifts
or hospitality.

QQ

We need to use an intermediary to run
an important negotiation, and I have
someone lined up, but there’s no time to
get approvals. The deal is the important
thing, isn’t it?

AA

No. You cannot use an intermediary that
is not approved through the Rolls‑Royce
due diligence process. Don’t start to
negotiate without a valid, approved
contract in place, and ensure the person
you had in mind does not act on behalf of
Rolls‑Royce. Contact your Sector Ethics

• Not undertake any other action or activity which
is intended to assist anyone else engaged in
tax evasion.

What happens when…

Our supplier has asked to change
some invoices this month so they can
categorise the supplies differently for tax
reasons. They are the best supplier in the
market, we have a great relationship with
them and I can’t afford to lose them,
is this ok?

AA

Requests like this might seem reasonable,
but it’s not ok. You could be facilitating
tax evasion and this may result in a
criminal prosecution for both you and

invoices with the correct amounts and

Group Policies
Export controls
Intellectual Property

We will:

• Make sure we understand and act in accordance
with the laws and regulations that apply to
exports and imports. This includes those of
other countries, when we are involved in
any transfers;
• Make sure we know about and do not
contravene national and international sanctions
and our own destination policies;
• Not travel with a laptop or other device
containing controlled technology unless we have
authorisation from the Export Control team;
• Not travel with products or spare parts unless
we have authorisation to export the items from
the Export Control team, and we have made the
required customs import declarations; and
• Be alert for suspicious enquiries from individuals,
organisations or people acting on behalf of
others who might be attempting to gain illicit
access to our goods, software or technology.

What happens when…
QQ

We are in arrears to a customer on a
part that is awaiting an export licence.
I am visiting the customer next week.
Surely it would save time and money if
I took the part with me and sorted out
the paperwork afterwards?

AA

No. We always work within import and
export laws because breaching these
laws could expose us to serious risks –
it would undermine our credibility with
the customer, might be a risk to national
security and expose us to legal sanctions
which would damage our reputation.

QQ

I need to send a drawing of a component
to a new potential supplier. I’m aware
that I need to get authorisation but don’t
know how to go about it.

AA

Start by preparing a detailed description
of the transaction and talk it through with
your local Export Point of Contact or
experts in Export Controls, Security and
Intellectual Property.

QQ

A customer has asked me to change
the description of some goods on its
shipping documents because it means
they’ll pay less tax on the import of those
goods. They are a good customer and
I don’t want to upset them so this is ok
isn’t it?

No. This could fall under ‘facilitating
tax evasion’ and could result in a

permitted to, and we never share it externally
without authorisation.
• We never use illegal or dishonest methods to
get information.
• We do not try to find or use the information of other
people or organisations, including competitors, that
we know is confidential or restricted.

We will:

• Keep all documents, or any form of information
we’ve been given in confidence secure,
in line with business procedures and any
appropriate laws;
• Not try to find or accept confidential information
about other organisations or people without
their permission;
• Not try to get access to classified information if it
is not required for legitimate business purposes
or if we are not authorised to have it; and
• Not share confidential information belonging
to an external person or organisation without
that person or organisation’s permission.
This includes sharing the information internally.

What happens when…
QQ

I was negotiating with a customer on a
recent sales visit, and he gave me a copy
of our competitor’s price list to persuade
me to lower our price. This could be
useful information for us, can I use it?

AA

No. Competitor pricing information
which is not publicly available is not ours
to use, regardless of whether a customer
gave it to you. Do not use it and contact
your Sector Ethics and Compliance
Officer as soon as possible. It may be
necessary to tell the competitor we have
their information, remove you from
any sales activity or even to withdraw
Rolls-Royce from the process entirely.

QQ

I am managing a supplier tender process
and am under pressure to cut costs.
I have chosen a preferred supplier who
I know is also used by one of our joint
ventures. Can I benchmark their price
by checking what our joint venture
is paying?

AA

No. The supplier’s agreed pricing
with the joint venture is confidential.
Although Rolls‑Royce owns part of the
joint venture, this information belongs
to the supplier and the joint venture
company and not Rolls-Royce.

We will:

which result in price fixing, bid rigging, market

Arrangements like this are almost always illegal,
and are often criminal;
• Not share commercially sensitive information
with competitors, trade associations or industry
bodies. This might include information about
prices, ongoing bids, terms and conditions of
sales, market share, costs or profit margins;
• Check carefully before we make agreements with
trade associations, industry bodies, customers,
joint venture partners or suppliers so we are clear
about any existing restrictions on who they can
sell to or buy from, and on what terms; and
• In markets where we might be said to have
‘market power’ (including some of our
aftermarkets), take care over arrangements
which might be seen unfairly to exclude
competitors or exploit customers.
